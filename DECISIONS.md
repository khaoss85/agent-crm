# Architectural decisions

## ADR-001 — Standard-library-first proof of concept

**Status:** accepted

The first vertical slice uses Node.js built-ins, including `node:http`, `node:test` and `node:sqlite`. This keeps setup immediate for Codex/Claude and makes the framework mechanics visible. A production adapter may later replace SQLite without changing module service contracts.

## ADR-002 — Services and workflows own mutations

**Status:** accepted

API, Admin, CLI and MCP may only mutate CRM state through module services or workflows. This makes validation, trace, audit and approval consistent across every interface.

## ADR-003 — Human approval is deterministic policy

**Status:** accepted

Moving a renewal worth at least €50,000 to Proposal creates an approval request and moves it to Approval Pending. An AI model may explain or recommend, but it does not override this policy.

## ADR-004 — MCP scaffolding defaults to dry-run

**Status:** accepted

The module scaffolding tool returns a file plan unless the caller explicitly passes `apply: true`. This reduces accidental repository writes from an AI client.

## ADR-005 — Compatible MCP surface

**Status:** accepted

The stdio server supports the established `initialize` lifecycle and the newer `server/discover` request, with tools/resources/prompts shared across both surfaces.
